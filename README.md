# Awesome Chocolat EDA & Visualization
Data Visualization Master Class - final exercise

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Introduction
This analysis represents the culmination of the Chandoo Data Analysis Master Class.  
The objective was to develop DAX measures and functions, along with a time intelligence table, to effectively showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.  
The goal was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sales data, highlighting critical insights and trends.
As part of this analysis, a switcher for metrics was developed in the timeline visualization, allowing for dynamic and interactive exploration of different metrics over time. Additionally, a tooltip was created to provide detailed information on data points, enhancing the overall user experience and making the analysis more insightful and actionable.

### Analysis
**Total Sales and Boxes Sold:** The total sales amount to $34,042,511.25, with a total of 2,077,844 boxes sold. This indicates a substantial volume of transactions and a significant revenue stream, reflecting the company's strong market presence and demand for its products.  
  
**Sales and Boxes by Geography:** Sales are well-distributed across various geographies (Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, UK, and the USA). Each region shows a healthy distribution of sales, indicating a well-diversified market presence and the effectiveness of the company's global sales strategy.  
  
**Sales and Boxes by Product:** The product-wise sales reveal that "Organic Choco Syrup" and "Peanut Butter Cubes" are the top-selling products, contributing significantly to the total sales. This suggests a strong consumer preference for these products, highlighting potential areas for further investment and marketing efforts.  
  
**Sales and Boxes by Sales Person:** The sales person-wise analysis shows that Kelci Walkden and Rafaelita Blaksland are the top performers, indicating their effectiveness in driving sales. This could be attributed to their sales strategies, customer relationships, and market knowledge. Recognizing and replicating their successful approaches could benefit the broader sales team.  
  
**Low Box Shipments:** Shipments under 50 boxes account for 10.21% of total boxes. While low box shipments represent a smaller portion of overall sales, they still contribute a notable amount. This could be due to high-value products being shipped in smaller quantities, suggesting a niche market segment that the company can further explore and develop.  
  
**Sales Over Time:** The sales trend over time shows fluctuations, with certain periods experiencing higher sales volumes. These variations could be due to seasonal demand, promotional activities, or other market dynamics. Understanding these trends can help in planning future sales strategies and optimizing inventory management.  
  
**Cost and Profit Analysis:** The total costs are $13,518,440.90 for this analysis. The Total Profit, calculated as Total Sales minus Total Costs, amounts to $20,524,070.30. This indicates a healthy profit margin and effective cost management. The significant profit highlights the company's ability to generate substantial revenue while controlling costs, underscoring its financial health and operational efficiency.  
  
### Conclusion  
The analysis reveals a well-distributed sales performance across geographies, products, and salespersons. The presence of low box shipments indicates a market for high-value, low-quantity products.  
The sales trends over time provide insights into market dynamics and can help in planning future sales strategies. The total profit highlights the financial health of the business, showcasing effective cost management and strong revenue generation.
